Printer World is a company idea with the idea of creating print-on-demand 3D printed products to sell to customers online. Customers would be able to purchase pre-made 3D models or upload their own modles to print.
This is a quickly-made website made for the company that does not have any backend coding, only serving as a model for the fontend of the website.
This website has no true functionallity for a real company and should not be treated as such.
